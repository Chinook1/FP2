## My Library: Ring-Buffer
My name: John Kuczynski.

I installed the ring-buffer package. Then, I used the functions to create a empty ring-buffer of length 3, and put numbers in it. After that, I then created a simple function that needed to be sent a ring-buffer and a value. If the value was found, its location is returned; otherwise return false. After that, I created a function which would allow the user to remove the value at the given location, and replace it with null.
